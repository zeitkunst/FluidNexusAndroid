"Fluid Nexus is an application for mobile phones that is primarily "
"designed to enable activists or relief workers to send messages and data "
"amongst themselves independent of a centralized cellular network. The "
"idea is to provide a means of communication between people when the "
"centralized network has been shut down, either by the government during a"
" time of unrest, or by nature due to a massive disaster. During such "
"times the use of the centralized network for voice or SMS is not "
"possible. Yet, if we can use the fact that people still must move about "
"the world, then we can use ideas from sneaker-nets to turn people into "
"carriers of data. Given enough people, we can create fluid, temporary, "
"ad-hoc networks that pass messages one person at a time, spreading out as"
" a contagion and eventually reaching members of the group. This enables "
"surreptitious communication via daily activity and relies on a fluid view"
" of reality. Additionally, Fluid Nexus can be used as a hyperlocal "
"message board, loosely attached to physical locations.\n"
" \n"
" Fluid Nexus is not designed as a general-purpose piece of software; "
"rather, it is developed with specific types of users in mind. Thus, while"
" the ideas here could be very useful for social-networking or "
"productivity applications, this is not what I am most interested in. "
"However, I definitely welcome the extension of these ideas into these "
"other domains. Indeed, Fluid Nexus is related to work in the following "
"projects: mesh networking in the OLPC ( "
"http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Mesh_Network_Details ), the Haggle project ( "
"http://www.haggleproject.org/ ), and Comm.unity ( "
"http://community.mit.edu/ ), among many others.\n"
" \n"
" BLUETOOTH SIMULATION: For the purposes of this competition, I have "
"simulated Bluetooth connections since the emulator does not at present "
"support Bluetooth natively. There are two different types of simulation. "
"The first is a purely software version that fires Bluetooth events for "
"both the client and the server. The second is a bridge that sits outside "
"of the emulator and connects, over a forwarded TCP socket, the emulator "
"to the host Bluetooth adapter. This bridge is written in python using the"
" lightblue (http://lightblue.sourceforge.net ) library. For the "
"competition I show notifications for all device and service discovery, as"
" well as for sending outgoing messages; in an actual application, these "
"notifications would not be shown.\n"
" \n"
" MESSAGE FORWARDING: Right now we only implement broadcast-style "
"forwarding; future versions will allow the creation of pre-defined groups"
" for more limited distribution. The forwarding algorithm works by "
"reappropriating the advertisement of Bluetooth services to advertise "
"hashes of already-received messages. This is similar to what many insects"
" do in the wild, by leaving traces of prior activity in an area, known as"
" stigmergy. Thus messages leave traces of where they've been, via the "
"advertisement of their hashes, thus greatly increasing the efficiency of "
"this broadcast-style forwarding algorithm. For more information, please "
"see the PDF documentation available online ( "
"http://fluidnexus.net/media/pdf/FluidNexusAndroid.pdf )."

"&lt;p&gt;In the second decade of the twenty-first century, networks "
"continue to be defined by their stable topology represented in an image "
"or graph. Peer-to-peer technologies promised new arrangements absent "
"centralized control, but they still rely on stationary devices. Mobile "
"phones remain wedded to conventional network providers.&lt;/p&gt; "
"&lt;p&gt;Instead, the combination of peer-to-peer with mobility enables a"
" new concept of an information transfer infrastructure that relies on "
"fluid, temporary, ad-hoc networks. People and devices are at once "
"implicated as mobile nodes in this network (known in computer science as "
"a sneakernet (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet)).&lt;/p&gt; "
"&lt;p&gt;Fluid Nexus bypasses Internet intermediaries' control over the "
"identification and circulation of messages. This makes Fluid Nexus an "
"important tool for activists. Access to the data stored by Fluid Nexus "
"requires a search warrant for &lt;em&gt;your own&lt;/em&gt; "
"devices&mdash;or another device running the software. No identifying "
"information regarding the sender is attached to a message, putting the "
"sender in control. And in conjunction with other software such as "
"ObscuraCam (https://guardianproject.info/apps/securecam/) identities can "
"be further obfuscated as desired or necessary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the "
"event that information needs to reach a broad audience, we've added "
"another feature called the Nexus (http://fluidnexus.net/nexus). The Nexus"
" is a space on this site for public messages to be automatically uploaded"
" by any Fluid Nexus user. The Nexus includes text, audio, images, and "
"video capabilities. The sender has control whether the message will "
"become public or not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more information on Fluid "
"Nexus, see the paper Transnetworks and the Fluid Nexus Project "
"(http://fluidnexus.net/static/pdfs/DCM2009Submitted.pdf), forthcoming in "
"Fall 2011 in the proceedings of dis/connecting/media 2009.&lt;/p&gt;"
