    <string name="help_help_text">There are two types of messages in Fluid Nexus.  The first, \"outgoing\", are messages you have created and that are designed to be the first ones sent to other nearby phones.  These are indicated by the icon with the arrow pointing  left, outside of the device.  The second are messages that you have received from other phones; these are indicated by the icon without the arrow.  Your phone will try and send these messages after it has sent all of the messages marked as outgoing.\n
\n
VIEWING A MESSAGE: Simply click/tap/hit enter on a message to open a window that allows you to see the entirety of the message.\n
DELETING A MESSAGE: Once you have selected a message using the keyboard or direction pad, open the menu and select \"Delete message\" to remove it from the database and advertisements.\n
ADDING A MESSAGE: Open the menu and select \"New Message\".  Enter your message, select save, and it will be queued for for sending, as well as appearing in your message list.\n
VIEW ALL MESSAGES: The default opening view of Fluid Nexus, this shows all of the messages on your device.  You can also return to this view by opening the menu and selecting \"View All\".\n
VIEW OUTGOING: This shows you only the messages you have created and that are thus marked as \"outgoing\".  You can select this by opening the menu and selecting \"View Outgoing\".\n

    <string name="help_concept_text">Fluid Nexus is an application for mobile phones that is primarily designed to enable activists or relief workers to send messages and data amongst themselves independent of a centralized cellular network.  The idea is to provide a means of communication between people when the centralized network has been shut down, either by the government during a time of unrest, or by nature due to a massive disaster.  During such times the use of the centralized network for voice or SMS is not possible.  Yet, if we can use the fact that people still must move about the world, then we can use ideas from sneaker-nets to turn people into carriers of data.  Given enough people, we can create fluid, temporary, ad-hoc networks that pass messages one person at a time, spreading out as a contagion and eventually reaching members of the group.  This enables surreptitious communication via daily activity and relies on a fluid view of reality.  Additionally, Fluid Nexus can be used as a hyperlocal message board, loosely attached to physical locations.\n
\n
Fluid Nexus is not designed as a general-purpose piece of software; rather, it is developed with specific types of users in mind.  Thus, while the ideas here could be very useful for social-networking or productivity applications, this is not what I am most interested in.  However, I definitely welcome the extension of these ideas into these other domains.  Indeed, Fluid Nexus is related to work in the following projects: mesh networking in the OLPC ( http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Mesh_Network_Details ), the Haggle project ( http://www.haggleproject.org/ ), and Comm.unity ( http://community.mit.edu/ ), among many others.\n
\n
BLUETOOTH SIMULATION: For the purposes of this competition, I have simulated Bluetooth connections since the emulator does not at present support Bluetooth natively.  There are two different types of simulation.  The first is a purely software version that fires Bluetooth events for both the client and the server.  The second is a bridge that sits outside of the emulator and connects, over a forwarded TCP socket, the emulator to the host Bluetooth adapter.  This bridge is written in python using the lightblue (http://lightblue.sourceforge.net ) library.  For the competition I show notifications for all device and service discovery, as well as for sending outgoing messages; in an actual application, these notifications would not be shown.\n
\n
MESSAGE FORWARDING: Right now we only implement broadcast-style forwarding; future versions will allow the creation of pre-defined groups for more limited distribution.  The forwarding algorithm works by reappropriating the advertisement of Bluetooth services to advertise hashes of already-received messages.  This is similar to what many insects do in the wild, by leaving traces of prior activity in an area, known as stigmergy.  Thus messages leave traces of where they\'ve been, via the advertisement of their hashes, thus greatly increasing the efficiency of this broadcast-style forwarding algorithm.  For more information, please see the PDF documentation available online ( http://fluidnexus.net/media/pdf/FluidNexusAndroid.pdf ).

    <string name="about_text"><![CDATA[
        <p>Fluid Nexus is an intervention into staid practices surrounding networks. In the second decade of the twenty-first century, networks continue to be defined by their stable topology, their ability to be captured in an image or graph. Peer-to-peer technologies have promised new arrangements absent centralized control, but they still rely on stationary devices. Mobile phones bring movement and motion but nevertheless remain wedded to conventional network providers.</p>
        <p>Networks do not need to be understood as stable entities with well-traversed paths. Instead, we can combine peer-to-peer with movement to use machines and humans as equal parts of an information transfer infrastructure. Fluid, temporary, ad-hoc networks can be created and destroyed as necessary, passing information from one person to another, spreading out as a contagion and eventually reaching everyone using the service. People become mobile nodes in the network (known in computer science as a sneakernet (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet)) while their devices take care of transferring data from one device to another.</p>
        <p>Since information in Fluid Nexus does not travel through any centralized networks it cannot be saved by any Internet intermediary, potentially revealing identifiable information. Nor can any intermediary decide to censor a particular message. These facts make Fluid Nexus an important tool for activists. Access to the data stored by Fluid Nexus requires a search warrant&mdash;or another device running the software. Indeed it is this "broadcast" nature of Fluid Nexus that makes it such a potent tool. In the long-run, anyone else running the software will eventually have every message sent by any other user, making it nigh impossible to censor any single message. No identifying information regarding the sender is attached to a message&mdash;the sender is in control of what he or she wishes to reveal. And in conjunction with other software such as ObscuraCam (https://guardianproject.info/apps/securecam/) identities can be further obfuscated as desired or necessary.</p>

        <p>Yet sometimes it is important for information to reach a broader audience, and at this time that requires going through the Internet. To facilitate this we\'ve created the Nexus (http://fluidnexus.net/nexus), a place for certain types of messages which are marked as "public" to be automatically uploaded by any Fluid Nexus user to this website. Again, the control of whether a message can be uploaded or not is left in the fingertips of the sender. The Nexus can become a place to distribute necessary bits of text, audio, images, and video to a wider audience.</p>
        <p>For more information regarding our theoretical motivations, see the paper "Transnetworks and the Fluid Nexus Project" (http://fluidnexus.net/static/pdfs/DCM2009Submitted.pdf), to be published in Fall 2011 in the proceedings of dis/connecting/media 2009.</p>
