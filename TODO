== Bluetooth ==

* Setup UUID for FluidNexus services, implement (somehow) in Lightblue so that we can see it in Android (Possibly bd547e68-952b-11e0-a6c7-0023148b3104)
* Setup new version of FluidNexus protocol to allow for transmission of message hashes via sockets rather than in service list

== Zeroconf ==

* Write test case in Python and avahi, try out with laptops
* Probably can use existing FluidNexus protocol via zeroconf sockets (but need to check on this)
* Use existing Android libraries to implement on phone
