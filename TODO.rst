TODO
====

* Figure out why we can't resolve a zeroconf service created on Android

* Figure out good way to stop FN service upon request

* Add error toast on problems with oauth

* Add check if on bluetooth to not writemessages if size over limit

* Restore listview position on return to app; for some reason this isn't working properly in the code I have now

* Add rate limiting options: hashes to send, hashes to read, messages to send,  hash to send bias (newest, oldest, random); BUT, this requires some way to keep track of what hashes have been sent to another device!

* Take a look at ACM papers to examine distributed voting

* Perhaps add priority via normal/life-death; only allow text for high priority (cut out attachment UI); add view mode
